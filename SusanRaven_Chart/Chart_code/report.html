        <h3>Client Brief</h3>
        <p>Both charts have enabled the client to view his sales from a different perspective.  Rather than guessing which sales code generates the most turnover he can now see exactly where his marketing budget would be best spent.</p>
        <p>The canvas.js library allows you to dynamically change the type of chart by just changing the chart type in the JavaScript. Being able to view data from a different perspective can generate alternative channels of income generation in a targeted way.
                <p>
                    What, if any, effect has employing an additional mechanic had on the sales figures, have the sold hours increased?
                </p>
                <p> The client tells me that the jump in sales during July was due to the employment of an additional mechanic and the apprentice mechanic being in the workplace for an additional day each week.
                <p>
                    The client has found it difficult to identify trends in sales from figures alone. Viewing a graphical representation of key data and metrics will improve their ability to grasp information hiding in their data. </p>
                    <P>The chart will enable the client to visualize relationships and patterns between operational and business activities. One of the key benefits of data visualization is it enables users to more effectively see connections as they are occurring between operating conditions and business performance. </p><p>In todayâ€™s highly competitive business environment, finding these correlations among the data has never been more important.
                </p>
                <p>Unlike one-dimensional tables and charts that can only be viewed, data visualization tools enable clients to interact with data.

                </p>
                <p>The doughnut chart has allowed the client to see the annual turnover for each department's sales.  So for example, it is easy to see which areas of the business are most profitable.  He can now target his sales towards the most lucrative department.</p>
                <p>As a result of these findings the client the collation of the figures has made the client aware of poor areas of sales and seasonal differences.  He has decided to further drill down his cost departments and separate off his Taxi Mot Tests from the VOSA Mot tests.  This way he can see what percentage of his sales come from taxi customers as opposed to his normal sales customers.</p>
